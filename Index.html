    <h1>What You’ll Need for HOmemade Ice Cream</h1>

    <p>Grab these 5 ingredients and give it a go:

        
    <ol>Whole Milk — the colder, the better. Do use whole milk for the creamiest results.
Sugar — Nothing fancy, just plain old granulated sugar.
Heavy Cream — again, the colder the better.
Pure Peppermint Extract — feel free to sub with another extract flavor, like vanilla if you wish.
Semi-sweet Chocolate Bar, chopped into bits (you’ll need a 4oz bar, or you can use chopped-up chocolate chips.) </ol>
    <h3>The most inportant thing you will need is a Ice-cream Maker</h3>
    <h1>Instructions </h1>
    <ol>In bowl, use whisk to combine milk and sugar until dissolved.  Stir in heavy cream and peppermint.  
        Turn ice cream maker on and pour mixture in and let churn for about 25 min.
    During the last 5 minutes of churning, slowly add in chopped chocolate. 
        Transfer ice cream in airtight container for at least 2-3 hours before enjoying (if you can wait that long.)
    </ol>
